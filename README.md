## The Village

### Overview

This is a simulation of a family spending a cosy day at home. What tasks they choose to do are deterministic, but can change drastically based on their initial starting context.

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it with `sbt run`.
